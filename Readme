=============
About:
=============
This is a program designed to make it easier to create scratch holograms (see
http://www.eskimo.com/~billb/amateur/holo1.html). It allows the user to create a
3D model in Google SketchUp, and then convert that model into a pattern to
generate a hologram of the model. 

=============
Requirements:
=============
python 2.6 or 2.7 with Matplotlib and Numpy
Google SketchUp

=============
Installation:
=============
Currently, this is only tested on OS X 10.6 and 10.7. It can probably be made to
work on other systems relatively easily, but I haven't done so yet. 

Install SDXF from http://www.kellbot.com/sdxf-python-library-for-dxf/

Open up solid_pattern.rb: change the value of SCRIPTS_DIR to point to the
location of this Readme file, and change PYTHON_PATH to point to your python
executable. Next, copy (or symlink) solid_pattern.rb to your Google Sketchup Plugins
folder (/Library/Application\ Support/Google\ SketchUp\ 8/SketchUp/plugins/ on
OS X). 

=============
Usage:
=============
Create a new model in SketchUp (or open up one of the samples provided with this
distribution), and save it somewhere convenient. Then click Plugins -> Make
Solid Scratch Pattern... and save the *.pattern file IN THE SAME DIRECTORY as
the *.skp file (the SketchUp model itself). Shortly thereafter, the printable
pattern file (.pdf), the drawing file for CNC milling (.dxf), and simulated
views at two viewing angles (_view_+5.pdf, etc.) will appear in the same folder. 

A few notes on usage:
The 'depth' of the hologram is assumed to be along the x-axis of the SketchUp
model (negative x values are below the page, positive values are above it). The
initial viewing angle is pointed towards the current camera position (so moving
the camera viewpoint affects the generated hologram).
